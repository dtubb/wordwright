“But let’s be essentialy realistic—it’s closed to everyone.” That is exactly what abundance privilege is.

But abundance capitalism itself has also excluded us from our worn attention as it continuously expands its rapacious enclosure of new areas of accumulation as our minds and attention are commodified.

For Woolf, the Fernham of her imagination is impoverished. But all universities are utterly impoverished:

> “So, of course, we simply cannot have wine and partridges and servants wearing tin plates on their heads,” she said.
> “We can’t have abundance and sofas and separate rooms. The comforts,’ she said, quoting from one book or another, ‘will have to wait.’”

Her reflection? The sheer poverty of the college. The poverty of lack of wealth. Lack of capital. Across it all, a profound exhaustion.
The college could barely scrape together a little money. No time to really think. But no money for luxuriously unnecessary amenities.

Her mother—“a mother of thirteen children.” No time to earn money. "No time to seriously study, whatever it was:
"
> *archaeology, botany, anthropology, physics, the nature of the atom, mathematics, astronomy, relativity, geography.*
No time for prestigious funds and grants, lectureships and prizes, scholarships and bursaries for women.

Why not? All things being equal, Women had no time to endow their college. "Endowments would have required them not to have children, "for it would have been impossible to raise the money for an endowment with thirteen children."

As a matter of fact, a large number of participants had an abundance of ideas on a daily basis. 

“No, absolutely not, we can’t hamper that,” said the teacher. 

The reason for these changes is that the vast majority of them made an unintentional mistake repeatedly. 

All things being equal, each and every volunteer contributed. 

"Some might call this once again a piss-poor approach, but with respect to the final outcome, it was successful."
