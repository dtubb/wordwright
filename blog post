# Introducing WordWright: Your Automated Editing Assistant

WordWright is a powerful word processing pipeline that automates the editing steps I use daily. It processes standard input through various scripts to handle different editing tasks. Writing involves editing and revising, and making the text your own requires effort. WordWright simplifies this process by leveraging OpenAI's language model to correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors, and improve formatting and style. Additionally, it uses DeepL's rewrite engine to clarify text.

When writing a book, I often find myself editing or revising sections frequently. In the rush of writing ideas, I tend to make a a large number of typos. During the writing of my first few books, I spent considerable time correcting these errors. Earlier generations might have had typists, secretaries, and copy editors, but as a student, I never did. So, I would often do a first round of editing using spell checkers and grammar checkers. Years ago, for example, I created a simple screen macro that accepted the first suggestion in Word's spelling window. It wasn't always right, but more often than not, it was close enough.

WordWright adopts a similar concept. It uses various scripts to remove adverbs and clich√©s, and then it uses OpenAI and DeepL to fix grammar and lightly revise the text. I discuss this process on my [blog](https://www.tubb.ca/2023/06/writing-diary-9-on-a-morning-draft/).

I rely on this tool because I am not a good typist, making it my initial step in editing and the first step after making changes. However, I continue to revise the text multiple times afterward. It's an early editing tool, but it also risks losing a voice. So, I find it only really useful early on in the writing process.

## Features of WordWright

1. **Redundant Phrase Removal**: Inspired by Roy Peter Clark's "How to Write Short," it removes redundant phrases using a predefined dictionary of common expressions with more concise alternatives, without changing text in quotes.
   - Example: Replaces "in order to" with "to" but leaves "He said, 'in order to succeed...'" unchanged.
2. **Adverb Removal**: It removes adverbs from the text, without changing text in quotes, because my writing style systematically includes adverbs. I might add them back later, but removing them is the first step.
   - Example: Removes "quickly" from "She quickly ran" but leaves "He said, 'She quickly ran...'" unchanged.
3. **LLM Processing**: It asks a language model to process the text to correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors, and improve formatting and style.
   - Example: Corrects "teh" to "the" and improves sentence structure.
4. **DeepL Rewriting**: It calls DeepL's rewrite engine to clarify the text. This step should be used carefully, as sometimes it's helpful, and sometimes it's wrong. But generally, I find it a very useful first editor.
   - Example: Rephrases "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" to "The fast brown fox leaps over the lazy dog."
5. **Final Cleanup**: It does a final cleanup to normalize punctuation, spacing, and formatting.
   - Example: Ensures consistent use of em dashes and removes extra spaces.
